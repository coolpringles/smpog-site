<p><strong>SMPog V1 (The Original):</strong></p>
<p>One day Jamie (epic sith lord) decided to ask out local simp BUNNIAY to make a smp called SMPog. The rabbit, being a simp, agreed and began to make horrendous financial decisions, getting a 5gb ram plan for the server. Many factions were formed. The Gay Clan, (Dione, Jamie, Alphataz, Tom). The others such as Bunniay lived behind the Mount Gay. This included Mruh, Cyp3er and some other irrelevant people I don&rsquo;t remember. Astromations and pringle lived on the country side East of Mount Gay. The 3 nations lived in harmony, until someone attacked. Equr and his gang decided to assasinate big man Astromations. Soon after the organized assassination of Astromations by Equr, he went to burn down Astro and pringles' home. This was the first act of violence ever committed on any SMPog. This would cause coolpringles to go live with BUNNIAY and Astro to go live alone 1k blocks out. A few days after this, Astromations came to lightly tap Equr&rsquo;s shoulder, only to be ganged up on, have his sword stolen, and have his house burned down. Astro then decided that if he cant have a house, no one can, thus going on to commit mass arson. SMPog V1 died soon after.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SMPOG V2 (The Sequel):</strong></p>
<p>After a while of inactivity, pringles decided to restart SMPog. The new seed sucked balls so everyone was separated. Dione founed Poggins, a nation consisting of Astro, Dione, James, Tom, pringle and NabCab. With so much man power, Poggins quickly became the most powerful nation. Not much happened until the idea of making a community shopping district was put into place. Many people began constructing their shops, only for the SMP to to be terminated due to unpaid fees before construction was complete. After a big misunderstanding, Astro and pringles parted ways with BUNNIAY and SMPog was suspended indefinitely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SMPog V3 (The Failure)</strong></p>
<p>pringles and Astro decided to revive SMPog because BUNNIAY broke both her legs after eating too many carrots. This new SMP was modded, however not many people joined cause Sumpoon won&rsquo;t download the damned mods. So anyway. It failed. We don&rsquo;t talk about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SMPog V4 (Terrorists, Terrorists and More Terrorists)</strong></p>
<p>The main global power in SMPog V4 was Ghitalyland, a town founded and built by Astromaitons. A certain despised player called TheSteve250 griefed SMPog only for it to be quickly rebuilt and improved, reformed as New Ghitalyland. One night, pringles and Astro were chilling in Equr&rsquo;s faction, Ass Town, but they were against that and decided to declare a battle. coolpringles, while unprepared was completely up for it, however Astro was careful, and used his strength and regen pots. The battle of Ass Town then commenced, with coolpringles and Astromation 2v6ing Equr's faction because as Astro said &ldquo;A good king never seeks out war but most always be ready for it.&rdquo; Ghitalyland had won, with Equrs faction saddened. BUNNIAY had also returned but she decided to X-Ray because she doesn&rsquo;t know how to read rules. A couple days later, Equr, Mruh, and Swub griefed New Ghitalyland, they were quickly banned and reprimanded, and the town was rebuilt with creative though many items were lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SMPog V5 (Pretty Good So Far)</strong></p>
<p>SMPog V5 has been pretty chill so far. There have been no major acts of terrorism, everyone is stacked and logging on for vanity and Goodland is the global superpower, once again founded by Astro (absolute legend). The only threats of war are a dog uprising against HB by Amber and Fudge but that is unlikely cause they are so harmless.</p>
